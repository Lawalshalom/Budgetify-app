Project Description:

This app is designed to help users keep track of monthly expenditures against gross budget(salary). It prompts the user via email when expenditure on a particular item/service is over 95% of its allocated budget. And also sends the user daily reminder to document all daily expenses. Budget profile automatically gets deleted after 30 days, and the user is prompted to create another budget profile.

USAGE:

The user creates an account. Then creates a buget profile stating his gross monthly budget and at least one anticipated item and allocated budget for the item. He can add various item and their allocated budget later. He can edit each item to document his expenses. The app enforces that all expenses stay within the budget by sending email notification when expenses is above 95% of the allocated budget.
